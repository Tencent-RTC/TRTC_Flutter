  /// The speed test result will be used to optimize the SDK's subsequent selection policy. We recommend you perform the speed test before users place the first call, which will help select the optimal server. If the test result is not satisfactory, you can use a noticeable UI prompt to remind the user to select a better network. The test result is called back through [TRTCCloudListener.onSpeedTest].
